# Cryptocurrency Data Collection and Backtesting System - Detailed Workflow

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive cryptocurrency trading data collection, processing, and strategy backtesting system, focusing on high-quality data acquisition and effective strategy validation.

## Data Collection and Processing System Details

### 1. Data Collection Architecture

- **Multi-source Data Acquisition**:
  - Order book depth data (configurable depth, default 15 levels)
  - Historical transaction records (supports time window configuration)
  - Market indicator data (index price, mark price, latest transaction price, etc.)

- **Collection Strategy**:
  - Scheduled collection mechanism (configurable interval, default 5 minutes)
  - Continuous collection support (configurable collection duration)
  - Exception handling and retry mechanisms

### 2. Data Cleaning and Optimization

- **Raw Data Processing**:
  - JSON response parsing and validation
  - Null and anomalous value handling
  - Timestamp standardization

- **Data Structure Optimization**:
  - Separation of bids and asks data
  - Adding metadata to data (timestamps, trading instruments)
  - Handling missing fields and optional attributes

- **Storage Format Conversion**:
  - Original JSON preservation (for data integrity and traceability)
  - Structured CSV conversion (for analysis and import)
  - Categorized data storage (organized by type and time)

### 3. Data Transformation and Aggregation

- **Order Book Data Extraction**:
  - Best bid/ask price extraction
  - Bid-ask spread calculation
  - Market depth indicator generation

- **Trade Data Statistics**:
  - Trading volume calculation (total, buy, sell)
  - Price range analysis (highest, lowest, average)
  - Trade direction proportion statistics

- **Data Merging Process**:
  - Integration of order book and trade data
  - Time alignment and synchronization
  - Generation of comprehensive market snapshots

## Backtesting System Details

### 1. Strategy Implementation

- **Dual Moving Average Crossover Strategy**:
  - Long-period moving average for trend determination
  - Short-period moving average for entry/exit signals
  - Support for parameterized configuration (adjustable MA periods)

### 2. Trading Logic Processing

- **Signal Generation**:
  - Price and moving average relationship determination
  - Long/short position management
  - Position status tracking

- **Trade Execution Simulation**:
  - Market price execution simulation
  - Detailed trade logging
  - Real-time position profit/loss calculation

### 3. Performance Analysis and Evaluation

- **Key Metric Calculation**:
  - Total trades and win rate
  - Profitable trades and losing trades statistics
  - Total profit/loss and profit factor
  - Maximum drawdown (equity curve analysis)

- **Result Visualization**:
  - Moving average indicator display
  - Trade position marking
  - Automatic generation of detailed reports

## Technical Implementation Highlights

1. **Data Integrity Assurance**:
   - Multi-format storage ensures no data loss
   - Error handling mechanisms prevent collection interruptions
   - Dual storage of raw and processed data

2. **Efficient Data Structures**:
   - Data formats optimized for analysis needs
   - DataFrame efficient processing of large trading datasets
   - Multi-dimensional data indexing for easy querying

3. **Scalability Design**:
   - Modular architecture for easy addition of new features
   - Parameterized configuration supports different trading instruments
   - Adjustable collection frequency and data depth

4. **Practical Analysis Tools**:
   - Automatic calculation of market depth indicators
   - Real-time updates of trading statistics
   - Comprehensive evaluation of backtesting results
